## ðŸ“ˆ Versions

- `v0.1` - **Weather Bell** item : allows changing the weather _(clear / rain / thunder)_ on use _[and has soo ugly texture]_
- `v0.2` - **Polish sounds** : adds some memes on right-click entities _(yeah, even boats or falling gravel)_; now known as [BeaverCurve](https://github.com/Modekh-ab/beavercurve) mod;
- `v0.3` - _[in testing process]_ teleports player to another player (works on 2 players only) by key press.

>  Actually, modpack is in process of finishing (because there's not a lot of content), so, `v0.3` (if not `v0.2` +_+) is probably the last one ðŸ«¡
